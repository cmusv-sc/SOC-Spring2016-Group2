# SSNetwork

Scientific Social Network

18-655, Spring 2016, Carnegie Mellon University  

Scientists collaborate and publish papers together, to share their experiments, and other scientists may either communicate or comment on papers. In this project, we design and develop an SOA solution for scientific social network, based on scientists' co-authorship, citation relationship, and follow up relationship.
